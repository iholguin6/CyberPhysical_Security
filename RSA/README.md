# RSA Implementation
# Rough Draft
This Project is an implention of an IoT system that creates
a key pair, public and private.
It communicates with TCP/IP protocol but uses the public key to encrypt and the private key to decrypt.

 work in progress may add multithreaded server and aes to create hybrid encryption to make a more secure communication  

 todo:  
    implement code on a pi
        
    implement circuit to determine if pi is on mains power or   battery pack 

    if time allows add camera to pi
